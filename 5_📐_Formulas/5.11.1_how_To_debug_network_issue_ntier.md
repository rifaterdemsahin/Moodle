If your Docker container is running locally but localhost:80 is not opening up, there are several steps you can take to debug the issue systematically. I'll break down the process for you and then create a Mermaid flowchart to visualize the debugging steps.
Steps to Debug localhost:80 Not Opening
Verify Docker Container Status:
Check if the container is actually running. Use docker ps to list running containers. If the container (moodle_ap in your case) isn't listed, it might have stopped or failed to start.
If it's not running, use docker ps -a to see all containers (including stopped ones) and check its status.
Inspect Container Logs:
If the container is running but not responding, check the logs for errors using docker logs <container_id>. The container ID for moodle_ap in your image is 283502ad2939.
Look for errors related to the application (e.g., Moodle failing to start) or networking issues.
Check Port Mapping:
Ensure the container's port 80 is correctly mapped to localhost:80. In your image, the port mapping is 80:80, which looks correct. However, confirm that no other process on your host is already using port 80.
Use netstat -tuln | grep 80 (on Linux) or netstat -an | findstr 80 (on Windows) to check if port 80 is in use by another process.
Test Container Accessibility:
Try accessing the container using curl http://localhost:80 or a browser. If it fails, there might be an issue with the application inside the container or a firewall blocking the connection.
Check Container Network:
Ensure the container is on the correct network. By default, Docker uses a bridge network. You can inspect the network using docker network ls and docker inspect <container_id> to see the network settings.
Verify Application Inside Container:
Exec into the container using docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash (or /bin/sh) and check if the application (e.g., Moodle's web server like Apache or Nginx) is running.
For example, run ps aux inside the container to see if the web server process is active, or check if the application is listening on port 80 using netstat -tuln.
Check Host Firewall:
Ensure your host's firewall isn't blocking port 80. On Linux, you can check with sudo ufw status, and on Windows, check the Windows Firewall settings.
Restart the Container:
If everything seems fine but it's still not working, try restarting the container using docker restart <container_id>.
Check Docker Daemon:
Ensure the Docker daemon is running properly. On Linux, check with sudo systemctl status docker, and on Windows/Mac, ensure the Docker Desktop app is running.

Additional Notes
In your image, the moodle_ap container is running on port 80:80, and the container is up (as indicated by the green dot and "12 hours ago"). Start by checking the logs (docker logs 283502ad2939) and verifying if something else on your host is using port 80.
The moodle_db container is running on port 106 (likely MariaDB), which suggests this is a Moodle setup with a separate database container. Ensure the moodle_ap container can communicate with moodle_db on the same Docker network.
If you need more specific help (e.g., interpreting logs or network settings), let me know, and I can guide you further! Since I can't search for more details, this is based on my knowledge of Docker and Moodle setups. Would you like to search for additional resources on this topic?
