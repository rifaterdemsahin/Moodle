Thanks for sharing the logs and additional commands! Let’s analyze the situation and resolve the HTTP 401 error you're encountering with your Moodle setup.
Key Observations from the Logs and Commands
Moodle Logs (docker logs moodle_app):
The logs show a repetitive cycle of:
"Welcome to the Bitnami moodle container"
"Starting Moodle setup"
Configuring PHP options and validating settings
"Trying to connect to the database server"
"Running Moodle install script"
This cycle repeats every minute or so (e.g., 16:00:55 → 16:01:56 → 16:02:57, etc.), with no clear indication of the install script completing successfully.
There’s a consistent error: realpath: /bitnami/apache/conf: No such file or directory, suggesting an issue with the Apache configuration path in the Bitnami image.
Around 17:08:19.04, the logs show "Running Moodle install script," followed by a shorter restart cycle (e.g., 17:08:27.11, 17:08:28.91), indicating the container is restarting frequently.
Database Check:
docker exec -it moodle_db mysql -umoodle -pmoodle -e "SHOW DATABASES;" confirms the moodle database exists, alongside information_schema. This means the MySQL container is functioning and the database has been created.
Container Restarting:
docker exec -it moodle_app bash failed with "Container ... is restarting, wait until the container is running." This aligns with the logs showing the moodle_app container stuck in a restart loop, likely due to the restart: always policy in your docker-compose.yml.
HTTP 401 Error:
The 401 error suggests that Moodle is partially operational but rejecting requests, possibly because the installation hasn’t completed, or there’s an authentication misconfiguration.
Root Cause Analysis
The logs and behavior strongly suggest that the Moodle installation process is failing or timing out, causing the container to restart repeatedly. Here’s why:
Install Script Failure: The "Running Moodle install script" step doesn’t show completion (e.g., no "Moodle installation completed" message), and the container restarts shortly after. This could be due to:
A database connection issue (though unlikely, since the DB is healthy and accessible).
A timeout during installation (despite MOODLE_INSTALL_TIMEOUT: 1800).
An internal error in the Bitnami image related to the missing /bitnami/apache/conf directory.
Restart Loop: The restart: always policy keeps restarting the container when the install script fails, preventing you from accessing it or seeing detailed errors.
Apache Config Issue: The realpath: /bitnami/apache/conf: No such file or directory error indicates the Bitnami image expects an Apache configuration directory that doesn’t exist, which might be breaking the setup process.
Steps to Resolve
Let’s break this down into actionable steps to diagnose and fix the issue.
1. Stop the Restart Loop
To troubleshoot, we need to stop the container from restarting endlessly so we can inspect it.
Edit your docker-compose.yml and temporarily change restart: always to restart: no for the moodle service:
yaml
moodle:
  image: bitnami/moodle:4.2.2
  container_name: moodle_app
  restart: no  # Changed from "always"
  # ... rest of the config ...
Stop and restart the services:
bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
Wait a minute, then check the logs again:
bash
docker logs moodle_app
If it still restarts or exits, note the exit code:
bash
docker ps -a
Look for the moodle_app container’s STATUS (e.g., "Exited (1) 5 seconds ago"). The exit code can hint at the failure reason.
2. Check Detailed Logs
Since MOODLE_DEBUG: "yes" is enabled, the logs should provide more detail. Look for:
Any errors after "Running Moodle install script" (e.g., database errors, PHP exceptions).
Clues about why the Apache config directory is missing.
If the logs are still vague, proceed to the next step.
3. Inspect the Container Manually
Since the container is restarting, we’ll need to catch it in a running state or debug the filesystem:
Wait until docker ps shows moodle_app as "Up" (even briefly), then quickly run:
bash
docker exec -it moodle_app bash
If successful, check:
The Moodle config file: cat /bitnami/moodle/config.php (should exist if installation completed).
Apache logs: ls -l /opt/bitnami/apache/logs/ or /bitnami/apache/logs/ (if they exist).
Directory issue: ls -l /bitnami/apache/conf (to confirm if it’s missing).
If you can’t catch it running, start a new container from the same image with an override:
bash
docker run -it --entrypoint bash bitnami/moodle:4.2.2
Inside, explore /bitnami/ and /opt/bitnami/ to see if the expected directories exist.
4. Test Database Connectivity
Verify Moodle can connect to the database:
From the moodle_app container (if you get inside):
bash
mysql -h db -umoodle -pmoodle -e "SHOW DATABASES;"
If this fails, it’s a network or credential issue (unlikely, given your setup).
5. Fix Apache Config Issue
The realpath: /bitnami/apache/conf: No such file or directory error suggests a bug or misconfiguration in the Bitnami image. Possible fixes:
Update Image: Try a newer tag (e.g., bitnami/moodle:4.3 or bitnami/moodle:latest) in case this is a known issue fixed in later versions:
yaml
image: bitnami/moodle:latest
Then:
bash
docker-compose down -v  # Delete volumes to start fresh
docker-compose up -d
Override Entry Point: If the issue persists, create a custom entry script to bypass the problematic Apache config step (advanced; let me know if needed).
6. Verify Access
Once the container stabilizes (no restarts):
Visit http://localhost:8080 again.
If you still get a 401, try http://localhost:8080/login and use admin/admin123.
Expected Outcome
The container should stop restarting, and logs should show the install script completing (e.g., "Moodle installation completed" or similar).
You should access the Moodle login page at http://localhost:8080 with admin/admin123.
If It Still Fails
If the above doesn’t resolve it, please share:
Updated docker logs moodle_app after disabling restart: always.
Output of docker ps -a to see the container’s status.
Any findings from inside the container (if you get in).
This should pinpoint the exact failure point, and we’ll fix it from there!
