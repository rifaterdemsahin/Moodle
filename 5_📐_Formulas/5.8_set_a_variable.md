The error you're encountering is due to incorrect syntax when trying to set the environment variable. Here's why you're facing this issue and how to fix it:

1. Incorrect syntax: The command you used (`export MOODLE_DATABASE_PASSWORD: "StrongP@ssw0rd123"`) is not the correct way to set an environment variable in bash[1].

2. Colon and quotes: The colon (`:`) and quotes are not needed when setting environment variables in bash.

To correctly set the `MOODLE_DATABASE_PASSWORD` environment variable, use the following command:

```bash
export MOODLE_DATABASE_PASSWORD=StrongP@ssw0rd123
```

This command will properly set the environment variable without any syntax errors. After setting the variable correctly, you should be able to run the Moodle setup script without the "empty password" error.

If you need to include spaces or special characters in the password, you can use quotes like this:

```bash
export MOODLE_DATABASE_PASSWORD="Strong P@ssw0rd 123"
```

Remember to use strong, unique passwords for your database to ensure security[3].
