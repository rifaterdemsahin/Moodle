To get started with GitHub CLI, please run:  gh auth login
Alternatively, populate the GH_TOKEN environment variable with

It looks like you're facing authentication issues with the GitHub CLI. The problem is that while you're trying to use `gh` commands, your CLI isn't properly authenticated or the token isn't being properly passed through when using `sudo`.

Here are a few ways to solve this problem:

## Option 1: Modify your docker-compose.yml file instead

Instead of trying to forward ports with GitHub CLI, simply change the port mapping in your docker-compose.yml:

```yaml
services:
  moodle:
    # other configuration remains the same
    ports:
      - "8080:80"  # Changed from 80:80
```

Then restart your containers:

```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

This will make your Moodle instance accessible on port 8080 directly from your codespace.

## Option 2: Use GitHub Codespaces UI for port forwarding

1. In your GitHub Codespaces interface, look for the "Ports" tab (usually at the bottom of the screen)
2. You should see port 80 listed there
3. Click on the "Port Visibility" column and set it to "Public" if needed
4. Use the URL provided in the UI to access your application

## Option 3: Fix the authentication issue

If you want to use the CLI approach:

```bash
# Clear the environment variable first
unset GITHUB_TOKEN

# Then authenticate properly
gh auth login

# After successful authentication
gh codespace ports forward 8080:80
```

If you really need to use sudo, you can preserve the environment variables:

```bash
sudo -E gh codespace ports forward 8080:80
```

The simplest solution is probably option 1 or 2, as they avoid the authentication complications entirely. Which would you prefer to try?
