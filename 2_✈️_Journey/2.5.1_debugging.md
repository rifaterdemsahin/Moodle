# 🐞 Debugging steps for Moodle in Codespaces with Docker

## General Debugging Tools and Methods

### Docker Debugging Tools
1. [+] `docker logs <container_name>` - Check the container logs for errors and issues. 📝
2. [-] `docker ps` - Verify that your container is running. 🚨
3. [-] `docker exec -it <container_name> bash` - Access the running container for manual debugging. 🔍
4. [-] `docker-compose up` (if using Docker Compose) - Rebuild and restart containers with logs visible. 🔄
5. [-] `docker inspect <container_name>` - Review container details such as environment variables and network settings. 🧾

### PHP Debugging Tools
1. [+] Enable error reporting by adding these lines to `php.ini`: ⚙️
```ini
error_reporting(E_ALL);
display_errors = On;
display_startup_errors = On;
```
2. [-] Use `var_dump()` and `print_r()` for inline data checks. 🔍
3. [-] Install and configure Xdebug for advanced PHP debugging. 🐛

### Moodle Debugging Tools
1. [-] Enable debugging in Moodle by adding these lines to `config.php`: 🖥️
```php
@ini_set('display_errors', '1');
@ini_set('display_startup_errors', '1');
$CFG->debug = (E_ALL | E_STRICT);
$CFG->debugdisplay = 1;
```
2. [-] Check Moodle's error log files in `/var/www/html/moodledata`. 📄
3. [-] Verify Moodle plugin compatibility with the PHP version. 🔄
4. [-] Clear Moodle caches by running: 🧹
```bash
php admin/cli/purge_caches.php
```

### Database Debugging Tools
1. [-] Use `mysql -u <user> -p` to connect directly to the database. 🗄️
2. [-] Run `SHOW DATABASES;` to confirm the Moodle database exists. 📋
3. [-] Use `SELECT * FROM mdl_config;` to inspect Moodle configurations. 🔍

## Debugging Checklist
1. [+] Verify the Dockerfile syntax using `docker build .` for errors. ✅
2. [-] Check `.env` file values for typos or incorrect settings. 🧐
3. [-] Ensure PHP extensions are correctly installed inside the container. 🔎
4. [-] Confirm that Moodle files have proper permissions. 🛡️
5. [-] Inspect browser console for client-side issues. 🖥️

By following these methods, you should be able to identify and resolve common issues in your Moodle setup. Happy debugging! 😊
