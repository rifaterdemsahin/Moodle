The error `ERROR 2002 (HY000): Can't connect to local server through socket '/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock' (2)` indicates that the MariaDB container is failing to start properly. This issue is likely caused by the `command` section in the `db` service, which is attempting to execute MySQL commands before the database server is fully initialized.

### Steps to Fix the Issue:

1. **Remove the `command` Section**:
   The `command` section in the `db` service is trying to execute MySQL commands before the database is ready. Instead, we should initialize the database and grant privileges after the database is up and running. This can be done using an initialization script or by manually executing the commands after the container starts.

2. **Use an Initialization Script**:
   MariaDB allows you to run SQL scripts during the container's initialization phase. You can place your `GRANT` and `FLUSH PRIVILEGES` commands in a `.sql` file and mount it into the container's `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/` directory. This ensures the commands are executed after the database is initialized.

3. **Update the `docker-compose.yml` File**:
   Hereâ€™s the updated `docker-compose.yml` file:

   ```yaml
   version: '3.8'  # Specify the Docker Compose version

   services:
     moodle:
       image: my-moodle:latest  # Custom Moodle image
       container_name: moodle_app  # Name of the Moodle container
       restart: always  # Ensure the container restarts on failure
       ports:
         - "80:80"  # Expose port 80 for web access
       environment:
         # Moodle database configuration
         MOODLE_DATABASE_TYPE: mysqli
         MOODLE_DATABASE_HOST: moodle_db  # Database host (service name)
         MOODLE_DATABASE_PORT_NUMBER: 3306  # Database port
         MOODLE_DATABASE_NAME: moodle  # Database name
         MOODLE_DATABASE_USER: moodle  # Database user
         MOODLE_DATABASE_PASSWORD: "SafeP@ssw0rd-123"  # Database password

         # Moodle admin user configuration
         MOODLE_USERNAME: admin  # Admin username
         MOODLE_PASSWORD: "SecureAdminP@ssw0rd456"  # Admin password
         MOODLE_EMAIL: contact@rifaterdemsahin.com  # Admin email
         MOODLE_SITE_NAME: "Moodle LMS"  # Site name
         MOODLE_HOST: "rifaterdemsahin.com"  # Site host

         # PHP and Moodle performance settings
         PHP_MAX_EXECUTION_TIME: 300  # Max PHP execution time
         PHP_MEMORY_LIMIT: 256M  # PHP memory limit
         PHP_POST_MAX_SIZE: 50M  # Max POST data size
         PHP_UPLOAD_MAX_FILESIZE: 50M  # Max file upload size
         MOODLE_DATABASE_WAIT_TIMEOUT: 300  # Database connection timeout

         # Skip Moodle bootstrap (set to "no" for fresh installs)
         MOODLE_SKIP_BOOTSTRAP: "no"
       volumes:
         - moodle_data:/bitnami/moodle  # Moodle application data
         - moodledata_data:/bitnami/moodledata  # Moodle user data
       depends_on:
         db:
           condition: service_healthy  # Wait for the database to be healthy
       networks:
         - moodle-net  # Connect to the moodle-net network

     db:
       image: mariadb:10.6  # MariaDB image
       container_name: moodle_db  # Name of the database container
       environment:
         MYSQL_DATABASE: moodle  # Database name
         MYSQL_USER: moodle  # Database user
         MYSQL_PASSWORD: "SafeP@ssw0rd-123"  # Database user password
         MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: "RootP@ssw0rd789"  # Database root password
       volumes:
         - db_data:/var/lib/mysql  # Persistent storage for database files
         - ./init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql  # SQL script for initialization
       healthcheck:
         test: ["CMD", "mysqladmin", "ping", "-h", "localhost", "-u$$MYSQL_USER", "-p$$MYSQL_PASSWORD"]  # Health check command
         interval: 10s  # Check every 10 seconds
         timeout: 5s  # Timeout after 5 seconds
         retries: 10  # Retry up to 10 times
       networks:
         - moodle-net  # Connect to the moodle-net network

   volumes:
     moodle_data:  # Volume for Moodle application data
     moodledata_data:  # Volume for Moodle user data
     db_data:  # Volume for MariaDB data

   networks:
     moodle-net:  # Define a custom bridge network
       driver: bridge
   ```

4. **Create the `init.sql` File**:
   Create a file named `init.sql` in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml` file. Add the following SQL commands to it:

   ```sql
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON moodle.* TO 'moodle'@'%';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   ```

5. **Recreate and Start the Containers**:
   Run the following command to recreate and start the containers:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --force-recreate
   ```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Initialization Script**: The `init.sql` file is mounted into the `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/` directory, which is automatically executed by MariaDB during initialization.
- **Removed `command` Section**: The `command` section was removed to avoid running MySQL commands before the database is ready.
- **Health Check**: The `healthcheck` ensures the database is fully initialized before the `moodle` service starts.

### Debugging Tips:
- If the issue persists, check the logs of the `moodle_db` container for more details:
  ```bash
  docker logs moodle_db
  ```
- Ensure the `init.sql` file has the correct permissions and is accessible by the container.

This should resolve the issue and allow the MariaDB container to start properly. Let me know if you encounter further issues!
