Looking at the logs, I can see that the Moodle container is starting up and running the installation script, but it seems to be caught in a loop. It's repeatedly trying to set up Moodle but doesn't complete the process. Each cycle shows it trying again after exactly 60 seconds.

There are a few issues that might be causing this:

1. The error `realpath: /bitnami/apache/conf: No such file or directory` suggests there might be issues with the Apache configuration directory.

2. The installation script appears to be timing out or failing and then restarting.

Let's modify the Docker Compose file to fix these issues:

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  db:
    image: mysql:5.7
    container_name: moodle_db
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root
      MYSQL_DATABASE: moodle
      MYSQL_USER: moodle
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: moodle
    volumes:
      - moodle_db_data:/var/lib/mysql
    networks:
      - moodle_network
    restart: always

  moodle:
    image: bitnami/moodle:latest
    container_name: moodle_app
    ports:
      - "8080:80"  # Changed from 8080:8080 to 8080:80
    environment:
      # Database configuration
      - MOODLE_DATABASE_TYPE=mysqli
      - MOODLE_DATABASE_HOST=db
      - MOODLE_DATABASE_PORT_NUMBER=3306
      - MOODLE_DATABASE_NAME=moodle
      - MOODLE_DATABASE_USER=moodle
      - MOODLE_DATABASE_PASSWORD=moodle
      
      # Moodle configuration
      - MOODLE_USERNAME=admin
      - MOODLE_PASSWORD=admin123
      - MOODLE_EMAIL=admin@example.com
      - MOODLE_SITE_NAME=Moodle LMS
      
      # Required for GitHub Codespaces/Cloud IDE environments
      - ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes
      - MOODLE_SKIP_BOOTSTRAP=no
      - MOODLE_HOST=localhost:8080
      
      # Install timeout increase
      - MOODLE_INSTALL_TIMEOUT=1200
      
      # PHP configuration
      - PHP_MAX_EXECUTION_TIME=600
      - PHP_MEMORY_LIMIT=512M
      - PHP_POST_MAX_SIZE=100M
      - PHP_UPLOAD_MAX_FILESIZE=100M
    volumes:
      - moodle_data:/bitnami/moodle
      - moodledata_data:/bitnami/moodledata
    depends_on:
      - db
    networks:
      - moodle_network
    restart: always

networks:
  moodle_network:
    driver: bridge

volumes:
  moodle_db_data:
  moodle_data:
  moodledata_data:

```

Key changes I've made:

1. Changed the port mapping from `8080:8080` to `8080:80` - the Bitnami container exposes Apache on port 80 internally

2. Added `MOODLE_HOST=localhost:8080` to ensure Moodle knows its external URL

3. Added `ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes` which might be needed in certain environments

4. Added `MOODLE_INSTALL_TIMEOUT=1200` to give the installation more time to complete

5. Increased the PHP execution time to 600 seconds to prevent timeouts during installation

After making these changes:

1. Stop all containers:
   ```
   docker-compose down -v
   ```

2. Create a new docker-compose.yml with the contents above

3. Start the containers:
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. Monitor the logs to see if installation completes:
   ```
   docker-compose logs -f moodle
   ```

If the installation still fails, we might need to try a different approach or investigate further into what's specifically causing the loop.
