Thanks for sharing the detailed docker inspect output for the moodle_app container (ID: e43d5c2d1a0a). This confirms it’s the correct container and provides valuable context. Let’s analyze the data and proceed with resolving the restart loop.
Key Insights from docker inspect
Container Status:
"Status": "restarting", "Restarting": true, "ExitCode": 1
The container is in a restart loop (66 restarts so far), exiting with code 1 (general error) shortly after starting. The last run started at 2025-03-15T08:54:45 and finished at 2025-03-15T08:54:46, lasting ~1 second before crashing.
Entrypoint and Command:
"Entrypoint": ["/opt/bitnami/scripts/moodle/entrypoint.sh"]
"Cmd": ["/opt/bitnami/scripts/moodle/run.sh"]
This matches the logs, where it reaches Running Moodle install script (part of these scripts) before failing.
Environment Variables:
Relevant settings:
"MOODLE_DATABASE_HOST=db", "MOODLE_DATABASE_USER=moodle", "MOODLE_DATABASE_PASSWORD=moodle", "MOODLE_DATABASE_NAME=moodle"
"MOODLE_DEBUG=yes", "PHP_MAX_EXECUTION_TIME=600", "MOODLE_INSTALL_TIMEOUT=1800"
These align with the working MySQL connection and suggest debugging is enabled, yet no detailed errors appear in the logs.
Mounts:
Two volumes:
"Source": "2_docker_moodle_data", "Destination": "/bitnami/moodle"
"Source": "2_docker_moodledata_data", "Destination": "/bitnami/moodledata"
Both are read-write ("RW": true), so permissions should allow writes unless there’s a host-side issue.
Network:
Connected to "2_docker_moodle_network", with aliases moodle_app and moodle. The database connection works, so networking isn’t the issue.
No Explicit Error:
"Error": "" in the State section means Docker itself isn’t reporting why it’s exiting—just that it’s failing with code 1.
Analysis
The container consistently fails after Running Moodle install script, and the realpath: /bitnami/apache/conf: No such file or directory error in the logs is a strong clue.
The rapid exit (~1 second) suggests the script crashes immediately after this step, possibly due to:
Missing Apache Config: The script expects /bitnami/apache/conf to exist, but it’s missing or misconfigured in the bitnami/moodle:4.3.3 image.
Script Failure: The install script might be encountering a fatal error (e.g., PHP timeout, dependency issue) not logged to stdout/stderr.
Volume Corruption: Data in /bitnami/moodle or /bitnami/moodledata could be causing the script to fail.
Action Plan
Let’s confirm the root cause and fix it. Please execute these steps and share the results:
1. Verify Container Status
Confirm the current state of all containers:
bash
docker ps -a
Share the output to ensure moodle_app (ID: e43d5c2d1a0a) is still restarting and moodle_db is healthy.
2. Interactive Run to Catch the Error
Since the logs stop at Running Moodle install script, let’s run it manually:
Stop the container:
bash
docker-compose stop moodle_app
Start an interactive shell:
bash
docker-compose run --rm moodle_app bash
Inside the container, run the scripts:
bash
/opt/bitnami/scripts/moodle/entrypoint.sh /opt/bitnami/scripts/moodle/run.sh
Share the full output, especially any errors after Running Moodle install script.
3. Check Apache Config Directory
The realpath error points to /bitnami/apache/conf. In the interactive shell (from step 2):
bash
ls -l /bitnami/apache/conf
If it fails (e.g., “No such file or directory”), check the parent directory:
bash
ls -l /bitnami
Share both outputs. If /bitnami/apache/conf is missing, it’s likely an image bug or misconfiguration.
4. Inspect Volume Contents
Check if the volumes contain unexpected data causing the failure:
From the host:
bash
ls -l /var/lib/docker/volumes/2_docker_moodle_data/_data
ls -l /var/lib/docker/volumes/2_docker_moodledata_data/_data
Share the outputs. If these directories are empty or have incorrect ownership (e.g., not root or 1001), it could be a permissions issue.
5. Test Without Volumes
If the above doesn’t resolve it, test without persistent volumes:
Edit docker-compose.yml to comment out the volumes:
yaml
services:
  moodle_app:
    # volumes:
    #   - moodle_data:/bitnami/moodle
    #   - moodledata_data:/bitnami/moodledata
Restart fresh:
bash
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose logs -f moodle_app
Share the logs. If it works without volumes, the issue is in the volume data.
6. Fallback to a Stable Version
If the problem persists, try an older, stable version:
Update docker-compose.yml:
yaml
image: bitnami/moodle:4.2.2
Restart:
bash
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose logs -f
Share the logs.
What to Share
Please provide:
docker ps -a output.
Full output from the interactive run (step 2).
Results of ls -l /bitnami/apache/conf and ls -l /bitnami (step 3).
Volume contents from step 4.
Logs from step 5 or 6 if you test those options.
With this data, we’ll identify whether it’s an Apache config issue, script failure, volume problem, or image-specific bug, and get your Moodle setup running smoothly!

The error no such service: moodle_app indicates that the service name in your docker-compose.yml file doesn’t match what we’ve been assuming (moodle_app). This mismatch explains why docker-compose run --rm moodle_app bash failed. Let’s correct this and proceed with debugging.
Analysis
In the docker inspect output you shared, the container name is /moodle_app (with a leading slash), and it has labels like "com.docker.compose.service": "moodle". This suggests the service name in your docker-compose.yml is likely moodle, not moodle_app.
The docker-compose run command expects the exact service name defined in the docker-compose.yml file.
Fixing the Command
Assuming your docker-compose.yml defines a service named moodle (not moodle_app), update the command accordingly:
bash
docker-compose run --rm moodle bash
Replace moodle_app with moodle to match the service name.
If you’re unsure of the service name, let’s confirm it by inspecting your docker-compose.yml.
Step 1: Verify the Service Name
Please share the contents of your docker-compose.yml file located at /workspaces/Moodle/6_🔣_Symbols/2_docker/docker-compose.yml. You can do this by running:
bash
cat /workspaces/Moodle/6_🔣_Symbols/2_docker/docker-compose.yml
Look for the services section and note the name of the service using bitnami/moodle:4.3.3. It’s likely moodle, but we need to confirm.
Step 2: Run the Correct Interactive Command
Once you confirm the service name (e.g., moodle), stop the existing container and start an interactive shell:
Stop the container:
bash
docker-compose stop moodle
Start the interactive shell:
bash
docker-compose run --rm moodle bash
Inside the container, run the entrypoint and script:
bash
/opt/bitnami/scripts/moodle/entrypoint.sh /opt/bitnami/scripts/moodle/run.sh
Share the full output, especially any errors after Running Moodle install script.
Step 3: Additional Checks (If Needed)
If the above still fails or you want to proceed with other diagnostics:
Confirm Container Status:
bash
docker ps -a
Share the output to verify moodle_app (ID: e43d5c2d1a0a) and moodle_db.
Check Apache Config (once inside the container):
bash
ls -l /bitnami/apache/conf
ls -l /bitnami
Share the results to investigate the realpath: /bitnami/apache/conf: No such file or directory error.
What to Share Next
Please provide:
The contents of your docker-compose.yml file.
The output of docker ps -a.
The full output from the interactive run using the corrected service name (e.g., docker-compose run --rm moodle bash followed by the script execution).
With this, we’ll align the service name, catch the exact error causing the restart loop, and resolve the issue!

Thank you for sharing the output from the interactive run! This is a significant step forward in diagnosing the issue with your moodle_app container. Let’s analyze the output and proceed with resolving the restart loop.
Key Observations
Interactive Run Progress:
You successfully ran docker-compose run --rm moodle bash (confirming the service name is moodle, not moodle_app), entered the container, and executed /opt/bitnami/scripts/moodle/entrypoint.sh /opt/bitnami/scripts/moodle/run.sh.
The output progresses past Running Moodle install script, unlike the logs from the restarting container, where it consistently stopped there.
No Immediate Crash:
In the interactive shell, the script didn’t exit with an error after Running Moodle install script. Instead, it returned to the prompt (root@e0e699990b65:/#), suggesting the script completed or is waiting for something (e.g., user input or a background process).
Apache Config Error:
The line realpath: /bitnami/apache/conf: No such file or directory still appears, indicating a potential issue with the Apache configuration directory. However, the script continues running past this point in the interactive mode, unlike the automated restarts.
Root Directory Listing:
Your ls command shows /bitnami exists, but you didn’t check /bitnami/apache/conf yet. This is critical to understanding the realpath error.
Database Connection:
The log shows Trying to connect to the database server followed by Running Moodle install script, and no errors, which aligns with the working MySQL connection (moodle_db).
Analysis
Why No Crash in Interactive Mode?:
When run interactively, the script might behave differently (e.g., waiting for input or not triggering a fatal error) compared to the automated docker-compose up scenario, where it exits with code 1. This could be due to:
A timeout or resource issue in the automated run.
A background process (e.g., Apache) failing silently when not attached to a terminal.
The install script expecting an interactive environment for initial setup.
Apache Config Issue:
The realpath: /bitnami/apache/conf: No such file or directory error suggests the script expects this directory, but it’s missing or misconfigured. Since the script continues in interactive mode, this might be a warning rather than a fatal error here, but it could still cause Apache to fail later, leading to the restart loop.
Install Script Behavior:
The Running Moodle install script step likely involves Moodle’s PHP-based installer (admin/cli/install.php). If it’s waiting for configuration or failing silently (e.g., due to Apache not starting), that could explain the restart in automated mode.
Next Steps to Resolve
Let’s confirm the Apache issue, check the install script’s outcome, and test a full setup.
1. Check Apache Config Directory
Since the realpath error references /bitnami/apache/conf, let’s verify its existence:
Start a new interactive shell:
bash
docker-compose run --rm moodle bash
Check the directory:
bash
ls -l /bitnami/apache/conf
If it says “No such file or directory,” list the parent:
bash
ls -l /bitnami
Share both outputs.
2. Verify Apache Process
The restart loop might be due to Apache failing to start. In the interactive shell:
bash
ps aux | grep apache
If no Apache processes are running, try starting it manually:
bash
/opt/bitnami/apache/bin/httpd -k start
Share any errors or the output of ps aux | grep apache after starting.
3. Inspect Moodle Install Script
The script stopped at Running Moodle install script. Let’s run it explicitly to see what happens:
In the interactive shell:
bash
php /bitnami/moodle/admin/cli/install.php --help
This checks if the CLI installer is available and shows its options.
If it works, try running the full install manually (using your env vars):
bash
php /bitnami/moodle/admin/cli/install.php \
  --wwwroot=http://localhost:8080 \
  --dbtype=mysqli \
  --dbhost=db \
  --dbname=moodle \
  --dbuser=moodle \
  --dbpass=moodle \
  --fullname="Moodle LMS" \
  --shortname="Moodle" \
  --adminuser=admin \
  --adminpass=admin123 \
  --adminemail=admin@example.com \
  --non-interactive \
  --agree-license
Share the output, especially any errors.
4. Test Automated Run with Debug
Since interactive mode didn’t crash, let’s enhance logging in the automated setup:
Stop and clean up:
bash
docker-compose down -v
Restart with verbose logging:
bash
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose logs -f moodle
Share the logs, especially anything after Running Moodle install script.
5. Check Volume Permissions
If the above doesn’t resolve it, the volumes might be causing issues:
From the host:
bash
ls -l /var/lib/docker/volumes/2_docker_moodle_data/_data
ls -l /var/lib/docker/volumes/2_docker_moodledata_data/_data
Share the outputs. Look for ownership (should be root or 1001) and permissions.
What to Share Next
Please provide:
Outputs of ls -l /bitnami/apache/conf and ls -l /bitnami (step 1).
Output of ps aux | grep apache and any errors from starting Apache (step 2).
Output of the Moodle CLI install commands (step 3).
Logs from the automated run (step 4).
Volume directory listings (step 5).
With this, we’ll pinpoint whether the issue is Apache-related, an install script failure, or a volume problem, and get your Moodle instance stable!

Thanks for providing the outputs! This gives us critical clues to resolve the restart loop issue with your Moodle container. Let’s analyze the results and determine the next steps.
Analysis of Outputs
Apache Config Directory Missing:
ls -l /bitnami/apache/conf returns No such file or directory.
ls -l /bitnami shows only moodle and moodledata directories, with no apache directory present.
This confirms the realpath: /bitnami/apache/conf: No such file or directory error in the logs is due to a missing directory. The Bitnami Moodle image expects Apache configs here, but they’re either misplaced or not included in this setup.
No Apache Process Running:
ps aux | grep apache shows only the grep process, meaning Apache isn’t running in the container.
This is significant because Moodle relies on a web server (Apache in Bitnami’s case) to function. If Apache fails to start due to the missing config, it could explain the container’s exit code 1.
Moodle Install Script Missing:
php /bitnami/moodle/admin/cli/install.php --help fails with Could not open input file: /bitnami/moodle/admin/cli/install.php.
This suggests the Moodle codebase isn’t fully present in /bitnami/moodle, which is unexpected since the logs mention Running Moodle install script. The script might be calling a different file, or the volume mount is incomplete/corrupted.
Volume Directories:
/bitnami/moodle and /bitnami/moodledata exist and are owned by daemon:root with rwxrwxr-x permissions, which should be fine for the container (Bitnami often uses daemon as the application user).
Hypothesis
Apache Failure: The missing /bitnami/apache/conf directory likely prevents Apache from starting, causing the run.sh script to fail silently after Running Moodle install script. In interactive mode, it doesn’t crash immediately because it’s not fully executing the web server startup.
Incomplete Moodle Installation: The absence of /bitnami/moodle/admin/cli/install.php suggests the Moodle files aren’t properly copied or mounted into /bitnami/moodle, possibly due to a volume issue or an image bug.
Image Bug: The bitnami/moodle:4.3.3 image might be misconfigured, missing essential Apache configs or Moodle files, leading to the restart loop.
Next Steps to Resolve
Let’s test these hypotheses and fix the setup.
1. Start Apache Manually
Confirm if Apache is the root cause by trying to start it:
In a new interactive shell:
bash
docker-compose run --rm moodle bash
Attempt to start Apache:
bash
/opt/bitnami/apache/bin/httpd -k start
Share any errors. If it complains about missing configs (e.g., /bitnami/apache/conf), that’s our culprit.
2. Check Moodle Directory Contents
The missing install.php is odd. Inspect the /bitnami/moodle directory:
In the interactive shell:
bash
ls -l /bitnami/moodle
Share the output. If it’s empty or missing key files (e.g., admin, config.php), the volume or image is at fault.
3. Test Without Volumes
The volume might be overwriting or failing to populate /bitnami/moodle. Test without it:
Edit docker-compose.yml to disable volumes:
yaml
services:
  moodle:
    # volumes:
    #   - moodle_data:/bitnami/moodle
    #   - moodledata_data:/bitnami/moodledata
Restart fresh:
bash
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose logs -f moodle
Share the logs. If it progresses past Running Moodle install script and Apache starts, the volume data was the issue.
4. Switch to a Different Image Version
If the above fails, the bitnami/moodle:4.3.3 image might be buggy. Try a known stable version:
Update docker-compose.yml:
yaml
services:
  moodle:
    image: bitnami/moodle:4.2.2
    # Comment out volumes as above
Restart:
bash
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose logs -f moodle
Share the logs.
5. Verify Image Integrity (Optional)
If you suspect a corrupted image pull:
Remove and re-pull the image:
bash
docker-compose down -v
docker image rm bitnami/moodle:4.3.3
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose logs -f moodle
What to Share Next
Please provide:
Output of /opt/bitnami/apache/bin/httpd -k start (step 1).
Output of ls -l /bitnami/moodle (step 2).
Logs from the no-volumes test (step 3).
Logs from the 4.2.2 version test if needed (step 4).
With this, we’ll confirm if it’s an Apache config issue, a volume problem, or an image defect, and get Moodle running stably!
