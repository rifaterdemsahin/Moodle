It looks like you're trying to set up a Moodle instance using Docker Compose, but you're encountering an HTTP ERROR 401 (Unauthorized) when accessing the page. Let’s troubleshoot this step-by-step based on your docker-compose.yml configuration and the output you provided.
Observations
Docker Compose Output:
docker-compose up -d successfully starts two containers:
moodle_db (MySQL) is marked as "Healthy."
moodle_app (Moodle) is marked as "Started."
The version: '3' warning is benign; Docker Compose has deprecated the version field, but it doesn’t affect functionality here.
HTTP ERROR 401:
A 401 error indicates an authentication issue. This suggests that Moodle is running but requires credentials or is misconfigured in a way that prevents access.
Configuration:
You’re using bitnami/moodle:4.2.2, mapping port 8080 on the host to port 80 in the container.
Environment variables define an admin user (MOODLE_USERNAME: admin, MOODLE_PASSWORD: admin123).
The database (moodle_db) seems properly linked to the app (moodle_app) via the MOODLE_DATABASE_HOST: db setting and the shared moodle_network.
Potential Issues and Fixes
1. Moodle Initialization Incomplete
The Bitnami Moodle image performs an initial setup when first launched (MOODLE_SKIP_BOOTSTRAP: "no"). If this process hasn’t completed or failed, you might see a 401 error because the app isn’t fully configured yet.
Fix:
Check the Moodle app logs to see if the initialization succeeded:
bash
docker logs moodle_app
Look for errors related to database connectivity, permissions, or timeouts. Since you’ve set MOODLE_INSTALL_TIMEOUT: 1800 (30 minutes), it should have enough time, but a slow system or network could still cause issues.
If the logs indicate a failure, stop and remove the containers, delete the volumes, and start fresh:
bash
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d
2. Accessing the Wrong URL or Port
You’re mapping 8080:80, so Moodle should be accessible at http://localhost:8080. If you’re trying to access it at a different URL (e.g., http://localhost without the port), you’ll get an error.
Fix:
Ensure you’re visiting http://localhost:8080 in your browser.
If you’re still getting a 401, try appending /login (e.g., http://localhost:8080/login) to see if it prompts for credentials.
3. Authentication Misconfiguration
The 401 error suggests Moodle is running but rejecting your request. This could happen if:
The admin credentials (admin/admin123) weren’t properly set during initialization.
Moodle is expecting authentication before showing the login page due to a misconfiguration.
Fix:
Check the logs (docker logs moodle_app) for any mention of admin user creation or authentication errors.
If the admin user wasn’t created, it might be due to a database issue (see below).
4. Database Connectivity
Although the moodle_db container is "Healthy," Moodle might not be connecting to it correctly. Common issues include:
The db hostname not resolving (unlikely since they’re on the same network).
The database not being fully initialized when Moodle starts, despite the depends_on healthcheck.
Fix:
Verify the database is accessible:
bash
docker exec -it moodle_db mysql -umoodle -pmoodle -e "SHOW DATABASES;"
If you see moodle in the output, the database exists.
Check Moodle logs for database connection errors. If there’s an issue, ensure the MOODLE_DATABASE_* variables match the db service’s environment settings.
5. Bitnami Moodle Specifics
Bitnami images sometimes have additional security layers. The 401 could be from an internal redirection or a misconfigured MOODLE_HOST (localhost might not work as expected inside the container).
Fix:
Try setting MOODLE_HOST to moodle (the service name) or leave it unset to let Moodle auto-detect.
Alternatively, if you’re accessing from outside the host (e.g., another machine), set MOODLE_HOST to the host’s IP or domain.
Steps to Resolve
Check Logs:
bash
docker logs moodle_app
Look for initialization messages, database errors, or authentication issues.
Verify Access:
Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.
If prompted for login, use admin/admin123.
Restart Fresh (if needed):
bash
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d
Then check logs again and retry the URL.
Debug Mode:
You’ve set MOODLE_DEBUG: "yes", so the logs should be verbose. If they’re not helpful, consider accessing the container directly:
bash
docker exec -it moodle_app bash
Check the Moodle config file (/bitnami/moodle/config.php) for clues.
Expected Outcome
Once resolved, you should see the Moodle login page at http://localhost:8080, where you can log in with admin/admin123. If the issue persists, share the moodle_app logs, and I’ll dig deeper!

  -?, --help          Display this help and exit.
  -I, --help          Synonym for -?
  --auto-rehash       Enable automatic rehashing. One doesn't need to use
                      'rehash' to get table and field completion, but startup
                      and reconnecting may take a longer time. Disable with
                      --disable-auto-rehash.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-auto-rehash to disable.)
  -A, --no-auto-rehash 
                      No automatic rehashing. One has to use 'rehash' to get
                      table and field completion. This gives a quicker start of
                      mysql and disables rehashing on reconnect.
  --auto-vertical-output 
                      Automatically switch to vertical output mode if the
                      result is wider than the terminal width.
  -B, --batch         Don't use history file. Disable interactive behavior.
                      (Enables --silent.)

                      Directory for character set files.
  --column-type-info  Display column type information.
  -c, --comments      Preserve comments. Send comments to the server. The
                      default is --skip-comments (discard comments), enable
                      with --comments.
  -C, --compress      Use compression in server/client protocol.
  -#, --debug[=#]     This is a non-debug version. Catch this and exit.
  --debug-check       This is a non-debug version. Catch this and exit.
  -T, --debug-info    This is a non-debug version. Catch this and exit.
  -D, --database=name Database to use.
  --default-character-set=name 
                      Set the default character set.
  --delimiter=name    Delimiter to be used.
  --enable-cleartext-plugin 
                      Enable/disable the clear text authentication plugin.
  -e, --execute=name  Execute command and quit. (Disables --force and history
                      file.)
  -E, --vertical      Print the output of a query (rows) vertically.
  -f, --force         Continue even if we get an SQL error.
  --histignore=name   A colon-separated list of patterns to keep statements
                      from getting logged into syslog and mysql history.
  -G, --named-commands 
                      Enable named commands. Named commands mean this program's
                      internal commands; see mysql> help . When enabled, the
                      named commands can be used from any line of the query,
                      otherwise only from the first line, before an enter.
                      Disable with --disable-named-commands. This option is
                      disabled by default.
  -i, --ignore-spaces Ignore space after function names.
  --init-command=name SQL Command to execute when connecting to MySQL server.

  --column-names      Write column names in results.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-column-names to disable.)
  -N, --skip-column-names 
                      Don't write column names in results.
  --sigint-ignore     Ignore SIGINT (CTRL-C).
  -o, --one-database  Ignore statements except those that occur while the
                      default database is the one named at the command line.
  --pager[=name]      Pager to use to display results. If you don't supply an
                      option, the default pager is taken from your ENV variable

  --protocol=name     The protocol to use for connection (tcp, socket, pipe,
                      memory).
  -q, --quick         Don't cache result, print it row by row. This may slow
                      down the server if the output is suspended. Doesn't use
                      history file.
  -r, --raw           Write fields without conversion. Used with --batch.
  --reconnect         Reconnect if the connection is lost. Disable with

  -V, --version       Output version information and exit.
  -w, --wait          Wait and retry if connection is down.
  --connect-timeout=# Number of seconds before connection timeout.

  --binary-mode       By default, ASCII '\0' is disallowed and '\r\n' is
                      translated to '\n'. This switch turns off both features,
                      and also turns off parsing of all clientcommands except
                      \C and DELIMITER, in non-interactive mode (for input
                      piped to mysql or loaded using the 'source' command).
                      This is necessary when processing output from mysqlbinlog
                      that may contain blobs.
  --connect-expired-password 
                      Notify the server that this client is prepared to handle
                      expired password sandbox mode.

Thanks for sharing the logs and additional commands! Let’s analyze the situation and resolve the HTTP 401 error you're encountering with your Moodle setup.
Key Observations from the Logs and Commands
Moodle Logs (docker logs moodle_app):
The logs show a repetitive cycle of:
"Welcome to the Bitnami moodle container"
"Starting Moodle setup"
Configuring PHP options and validating settings
"Trying to connect to the database server"
"Running Moodle install script"
This cycle repeats every minute or so (e.g., 16:00:55 → 16:01:56 → 16:02:57, etc.), with no clear indication of the install script completing successfully.
There’s a consistent error: realpath: /bitnami/apache/conf: No such file or directory, suggesting an issue with the Apache configuration path in the Bitnami image.
Around 17:08:19.04, the logs show "Running Moodle install script," followed by a shorter restart cycle (e.g., 17:08:27.11, 17:08:28.91), indicating the container is restarting frequently.
Database Check:
docker exec -it moodle_db mysql -umoodle -pmoodle -e "SHOW DATABASES;" confirms the moodle database exists, alongside information_schema. This means the MySQL container is functioning and the database has been created.
Container Restarting:
docker exec -it moodle_app bash failed with "Container ... is restarting, wait until the container is running." This aligns with the logs showing the moodle_app container stuck in a restart loop, likely due to the restart: always policy in your docker-compose.yml.
HTTP 401 Error:
The 401 error suggests that Moodle is partially operational but rejecting requests, possibly because the installation hasn’t completed, or there’s an authentication misconfiguration.
Root Cause Analysis
The logs and behavior strongly suggest that the Moodle installation process is failing or timing out, causing the container to restart repeatedly. Here’s why:
Install Script Failure: The "Running Moodle install script" step doesn’t show completion (e.g., no "Moodle installation completed" message), and the container restarts shortly after. This could be due to:
A database connection issue (though unlikely, since the DB is healthy and accessible).
A timeout during installation (despite MOODLE_INSTALL_TIMEOUT: 1800).
An internal error in the Bitnami image related to the missing /bitnami/apache/conf directory.
Restart Loop: The restart: always policy keeps restarting the container when the install script fails, preventing you from accessing it or seeing detailed errors.
Apache Config Issue: The realpath: /bitnami/apache/conf: No such file or directory error indicates the Bitnami image expects an Apache configuration directory that doesn’t exist, which might be breaking the setup process.
Steps to Resolve
Let’s break this down into actionable steps to diagnose and fix the issue.
1. Stop the Restart Loop
To troubleshoot, we need to stop the container from restarting endlessly so we can inspect it.
Edit your docker-compose.yml and temporarily change restart: always to restart: no for the moodle service:
yaml
moodle:
  image: bitnami/moodle:4.2.2
  container_name: moodle_app
  restart: no  # Changed from "always"
  # ... rest of the config ...
Stop and restart the services:
bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
Wait a minute, then check the logs again:
bash
docker logs moodle_app
If it still restarts or exits, note the exit code:
bash
docker ps -a
Look for the moodle_app container’s STATUS (e.g., "Exited (1) 5 seconds ago"). The exit code can hint at the failure reason.
2. Check Detailed Logs
Since MOODLE_DEBUG: "yes" is enabled, the logs should provide more detail. Look for:
Any errors after "Running Moodle install script" (e.g., database errors, PHP exceptions).
Clues about why the Apache config directory is missing.
If the logs are still vague, proceed to the next step.
3. Inspect the Container Manually
Since the container is restarting, we’ll need to catch it in a running state or debug the filesystem:
Wait until docker ps shows moodle_app as "Up" (even briefly), then quickly run:
bash
docker exec -it moodle_app bash
If successful, check:
The Moodle config file: cat /bitnami/moodle/config.php (should exist if installation completed).
Apache logs: ls -l /opt/bitnami/apache/logs/ or /bitnami/apache/logs/ (if they exist).
Directory issue: ls -l /bitnami/apache/conf (to confirm if it’s missing).
If you can’t catch it running, start a new container from the same image with an override:
bash
docker run -it --entrypoint bash bitnami/moodle:4.2.2
Inside, explore /bitnami/ and /opt/bitnami/ to see if the expected directories exist.
4. Test Database Connectivity
Verify Moodle can connect to the database:
From the moodle_app container (if you get inside):
bash
mysql -h db -umoodle -pmoodle -e "SHOW DATABASES;"
If this fails, it’s a network or credential issue (unlikely, given your setup).
5. Fix Apache Config Issue
The realpath: /bitnami/apache/conf: No such file or directory error suggests a bug or misconfiguration in the Bitnami image. Possible fixes:
Update Image: Try a newer tag (e.g., bitnami/moodle:4.3 or bitnami/moodle:latest) in case this is a known issue fixed in later versions:
yaml
image: bitnami/moodle:latest
Then:
bash
docker-compose down -v  # Delete volumes to start fresh
docker-compose up -d
Override Entry Point: If the issue persists, create a custom entry script to bypass the problematic Apache config step (advanced; let me know if needed).
6. Verify Access
Once the container stabilizes (no restarts):
Visit http://localhost:8080 again.
If you still get a 401, try http://localhost:8080/login and use admin/admin123.
Expected Outcome
The container should stop restarting, and logs should show the install script completing (e.g., "Moodle installation completed" or similar).
You should access the Moodle login page at http://localhost:8080 with admin/admin123.
If It Still Fails
If the above doesn’t resolve it, please share:
Updated docker logs moodle_app after disabling restart: always.
Output of docker ps -a to see the container’s status.
Any findings from inside the container (if you get in).
This should pinpoint the exact failure point, and we’ll fix it from there!
