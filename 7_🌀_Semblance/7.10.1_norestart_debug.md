Thanks for sharing the detailed container inspection output! This gives us a clearer picture of the moodle_app container's state. Let’s analyze it and resolve the issue step-by-step.
Key Observations
Container Status:
"Status": "exited", "Running": false, "ExitCode": 1
The container started at 2025-03-15T17:30:12.501861764Z and exited less than a second later at 2025-03-15T17:30:13.000325565Z.
An ExitCode of 1 indicates a general error during the execution of the entrypoint script (/opt/bitnami/scripts/moodle/entrypoint.sh) or the run script (/opt/bitnami/scripts/moodle/run.sh).
Restart Policy:
"RestartPolicy": {"Name": "no"}
You’ve successfully changed restart: always to restart: no, so the container isn’t stuck in a restart loop anymore. This allows us to debug without interference.
Environment Variables:
All the MOODLE_* environment variables look correct and match your docker-compose.yml (e.g., MOODLE_DATABASE_HOST=db, MOODLE_USERNAME=admin, MOODLE_PASSWORD=admin123).
MOODLE_SKIP_BOOTSTRAP=no means it’s trying to run the installation process, and MOODLE_DEBUG=yes should provide verbose output.
Volumes:
Mounted correctly: /bitnami/moodle and /bitnami/moodledata are linked to Docker volumes (2_docker_moodle_data and 2_docker_moodledata_data).
Network:
Connected to 2_docker_moodle_network, with aliases moodle_app and moodle. This should allow it to resolve db for the database connection.
Previous Logs Context:
From your earlier docker logs moodle_app output, the container repeatedly reached "Running Moodle install script" but didn’t complete, and there was an error: realpath: /bitnami/apache/conf: No such file or directory.
Root Cause Hypothesis
The container is exiting with an error (ExitCode: 1) shortly after starting, likely during the execution of the Moodle installation script. The previous logs suggest:
The script fails after "Running Moodle install script," possibly due to the missing /bitnami/apache/conf directory.
This could be a misconfiguration or bug in the bitnami/moodle:4.2.2 image, preventing the setup from completing.
Steps to Diagnose and Fix
1. Check Updated Logs
Since you’ve stopped the restart loop, let’s get the latest logs to see why it’s exiting:
bash
docker logs moodle_app
Look for any errors or exceptions after "Running Moodle install script."
If it’s the same as before (ending abruptly with no completion message), we’ll need to dig deeper.
2. Inspect the Exit Reason
Since the container exits quickly, let’s start it manually with an interactive shell to debug:
bash
docker run -it --entrypoint bash bitnami/moodle:4.2.2
