It appears you're experiencing an issue where your Docker containers are running, but accessing the application via `http://localhost` isn't working as expected. Specifically, you've mentioned:

- **Containers Running**: `moodle_db` (MariaDB:10.6) and `moodle_app` (my-moodle:latest)
- **Port Mapping**: `80:80` for `moodle_app`

Here are some steps to help diagnose and resolve the issue:

1. **Verify Container Status**:
   - Ensure both containers are running without errors. Execute `docker ps` to list active containers.

2. **Confirm Port Mapping**:
   - The `moodle_app` container should have its internal port 80 mapped to your host's port 80. This is typically done using the `-p` flag during container run, e.g., `-p 80:80`. Verify this mapping by checking the `PORTS` section in the `docker ps` output.

3. **Check Application Binding**:
   - Some applications bind specifically to `localhost` (127.0.0.1) within the container, making them inaccessible from outside. Ensure your application is configured to bind to all interfaces using `0.0.0.0`. This allows external access. citeturn0search4

4. **Inspect Firewall and Security Settings**:
   - Firewalls or security groups might block incoming connections to port 80. Ensure that your system's firewall allows traffic on this port.

5. **Review Application Logs**:
   - Access the logs of your `moodle_app` container to identify any issues during startup or runtime. Use `docker logs moodle_app` to view the logs.

6. **Test Direct Container Access**:
   - Obtain the IP address of the `moodle_app` container using `docker inspect moodle_app`. Attempt to access the application directly via this IP, e.g., `http://<container_ip>`. If this works, the issue might be with port mapping or host network settings.

7. **Network Mode Considerations**:
   - If you're using Docker's default bridge network, there might be networking issues. Consider running the container in host network mode for testing:
     ```
     docker run --network host my-moodle:latest
     ```
     Note: This mode isn't recommended for production but can help diagnose networking issues.

8. **SELinux or AppArmor Restrictions**:
   - Security modules like SELinux or AppArmor might restrict container operations. Check their logs and configurations to ensure they're not blocking access.

9. **Consult Official Documentation**:
   - Review the official Docker documentation for networking and port mapping:

10. **Community Support**:
    - Engage with the Docker and Moodle communities. Forums like Stack Overflow and the Docker Community Forums often have discussions on similar issues. citeturn0search1

By systematically following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the connectivity issue between your Docker containers and `http://localhost`.
