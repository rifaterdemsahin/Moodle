The error you're encountering—manifest for moodlehq/moodle-php-apache:latest not found: manifest unknown: manifest unknown—means that Docker cannot locate the latest tag for the moodlehq/moodle-php-apache image in Docker Hub. This could happen for a few reasons, and I’ll guide you through diagnosing and fixing it.
Why This Happens
No latest Tag Exists: The moodlehq/moodle-php-apache repository might not use the latest tag by default. Many maintainers (including MoodleHQ) prefer version-specific tags (e.g., 8.0, 7.4) to ensure stability and reproducibility, rather than a generic latest.
Temporary Docker Hub Issue: There could be a transient issue with Docker Hub’s registry, though this is less likely if the problem persists.
Local Cache or Network: Your Docker client might be failing to fetch the manifest due to a stale cache or network restrictions.
Steps to Fix
1. Check Available Tags
The moodlehq/moodle-php-apache image exists on Docker Hub (see https://hub.docker.com/r/moodlehq/moodle-php-apache), but we need to confirm which tags are available. Since you’re getting this error, the latest tag might not be defined. Let’s try a specific tag instead:
bash
docker pull moodlehq/moodle-php-apache:8.0
The 8.0 tag corresponds to PHP 8.0, which is compatible with recent Moodle versions. You can also try other tags like 7.4 or 8.1 depending on your needs.
2. Update Your docker-compose.yml
Since your docker-compose.yml is using moodlehq/moodle-php-apache:latest, update it to use a specific tag that works. Replace:
yaml
image: moodlehq/moodle-php-apache:latest
with:
yaml
image: moodlehq/moodle-php-apache:8.0
Save the file, then run:
bash
docker-compose up -d
3. Verify the Pull Works
If docker pull moodlehq/moodle-php-apache:8.0 succeeds, you should see output like:
8.0: Pulling from moodlehq/moodle-php-apache
Digest: sha256:...
Status: Downloaded newer image for moodlehq/moodle-php-apache:8.0
If it fails with a similar "manifest unknown" error, double-check the tag on Docker Hub (https://hub.docker.com/r/moodlehq/moodle-php-apache/tags) or proceed to the next step.
4. Clear Docker Cache (If Needed)
If specific tags also fail, your Docker cache might be interfering. Clear it with:
bash
docker system prune -a
Note: This removes all unused images and containers, so only do it if you’re okay losing them. Then retry:
bash
docker pull moodlehq/moodle-php-apache:8.0
docker-compose up -d
5. Alternative Image: bitnami/moodle
If moodlehq/moodle-php-apache continues to give trouble, consider switching to bitnami/moodle, which is well-maintained and includes Moodle pre-installed. Update your docker-compose.yml:
yaml
image: bitnami/moodle:4
Then:
bash
docker-compose up -d
Adjust environment variables as needed (Bitnami’s image has slightly different defaults).
What to Expect
After updating to moodlehq/moodle-php-apache:8.0 and running docker-compose up -d, you should see:
[+] Running 2/2
 ✔ Container moodle_db  Started
 ✔ Container moodle_app Started
Visit http://localhost:8080 to confirm Moodle is installing.
Why latest Failed
The moodlehq/moodle-php-apache maintainers likely don’t publish a latest tag to avoid ambiguity—each tag is tied to a specific PHP version (e.g., 8.0 for PHP 8.0). This is common for development-focused images where consistency matters more than always having the "latest" version.
Next Steps
Try the 8.0 tag first:
bash
docker pull moodlehq/moodle-php-apache:8.0
If it works, update your docker-compose.yml and run it. Let me know the output or any new errors—I’ll help you debug further! Ready to test this?
