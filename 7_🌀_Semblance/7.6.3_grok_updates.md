This appears to be a Docker Compose file for setting up a Moodle Learning Management System with MySQL. The configuration looks mostly correct, but I'll suggest a few fixes and improvements:
yaml
version: '3'

services:
  db:
    image: mysql:5.7
    container_name: moodle_db
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root
      MYSQL_DATABASE: moodle
      MYSQL_USER: moodle
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: moodle
    volumes:
      - moodle_db_data:/var/lib/mysql
    networks:
      - moodle_network
    restart: always
    # Add healthcheck to ensure database is ready
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "mysqladmin", "ping", "-h", "localhost"]
      timeout: 20s
      retries: 10

  moodle:
    image: bitnami/moodle:latest
    container_name: moodle_app
    ports:
      - "8080:80"  # This is correct - maps host 8080 to container 80
    environment:
      # Database configuration
      MOODLE_DATABASE_TYPE: mysqli
      MOODLE_DATABASE_HOST: db
      MOODLE_DATABASE_PORT_NUMBER: 3306
      MOODLE_DATABASE_NAME: moodle
      MOODLE_DATABASE_USER: moodle
      MOODLE_DATABASE_PASSWORD: moodle
      
      # Moodle configuration
      MOODLE_USERNAME: admin
      MOODLE_PASSWORD: admin123
      MOODLE_EMAIL: admin@example.com
      MOODLE_SITE_NAME: Moodle LMS
      
      # Required for GitHub Codespaces/Cloud IDE environments
      ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD: "yes"
      MOODLE_SKIP_BOOTSTRAP: "no"
      MOODLE_HOST: localhost  # Removed :8080 since it runs on port 80 inside container
      
      # Install timeout increase
      MOODLE_INSTALL_TIMEOUT: 1200
      
      # PHP configuration
      PHP_MAX_EXECUTION_TIME: 600
      PHP_MEMORY_LIMIT: 512M
      PHP_POST_MAX_SIZE: 100M
      PHP_UPLOAD_MAX_FILESIZE: 100M
    volumes:
      - moodle_data:/bitnami/moodle
      - moodledata_data:/bitnami/moodledata
    depends_on:
      # Updated to use condition based on healthcheck
      db:
        condition: service_healthy
    networks:
      - moodle_network
    restart: always

networks:
  moodle_network:
    driver: bridge

volumes:
  moodle_db_data:
  moodle_data:
  moodledata_data:
Key fixes and improvements:
Healthcheck Added: Added a healthcheck to the database service to ensure itâ€™s running properly before Moodle tries to connect.
Depends_on Improvement: Updated depends_on to use a condition that waits for the database to be healthy, preventing Moodle from starting before the database is ready.
MOODLE_HOST: Removed :8080 from MOODLE_HOST since inside the container, Moodle runs on port 80 (the port mapping 8080:80 handles the external access). Using localhost:8080 could cause connection issues internally.
Quotes Added: Added quotes to "yes" and "no" values for consistency and to prevent potential YAML parsing issues.
YAML Syntax: Removed the trailing > that seemed to be a typo.
Additional recommendations:
Consider using stronger passwords for MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD, MYSQL_PASSWORD, and MOODLE_PASSWORD in a production environment.
You might want to add command: --character-set-server=utf8mb4 --collation-server=utf8mb4_unicode_ci to the MySQL service for better Unicode support.
For production, you might want to specify specific versions (e.g., bitnami/moodle:4.3.3) instead of latest to ensure consistency.
To use this, save it as docker-compose.yml and run:
bash
docker-compose up -d
Then access Moodle at http://localhost:8080. The initial setup might take a few minutes due to the database initialization and Moodle installation process.
