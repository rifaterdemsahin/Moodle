Great progress! The updated logs from docker logs moodle_app after switching to bitnami/moodle:latest and adjusting the volume configuration show a different behavior compared to the previous 4.2.2 version. Letâ€™s analyze and proceed.
Key Observations
Logs Progress:
The setup process now reaches "Running Moodle install script" without the previous realpath: /bitnami/apache/conf: No such file or directory error.
New steps appear, like "Generating sample certificates," which werenâ€™t present in the 4.2.2 logs. This indicates the latest image (likely a newer version, such as 4.3 or 4.4 as of March 15, 2025) has an updated setup process.
The last line is "Running Moodle install script" at 17:37:06.78, but thereâ€™s no further output, suggesting it either hasnâ€™t completed yet or stalled.
No Immediate Exit:
Unlike the previous ExitCode: 1 within a second, the logs donâ€™t indicate an immediate failure. We need to confirm if the container is still running or has exited.
Volume Addition:
You mentioned "after adding the volume." If you added a volume for /bitnami/apache/conf or another path, it might have resolved the missing directory issue from the older image.
HTTP 401 Context:
If youâ€™re still seeing an HTTP 401 error, it could mean the installation hasnâ€™t finished, or thereâ€™s an authentication issue post-install.
Next Steps to Diagnose and Resolve
1. Check Container Status
Since the logs stop at "Running Moodle install script," letâ€™s see if the container is still running or has exited:
bash
docker ps -a
If moodle_app is "Up," the installation might still be in progress (it can take a few minutes, especially with MOODLE_INSTALL_TIMEOUT: 1800 set to 30 minutes).
If itâ€™s "Exited," note the ExitCode (e.g., Exited (1) or Exited (0)).
2. Monitor Logs in Real-Time
To catch any additional output or errors:
bash
docker logs -f moodle_app
The -f flag tails the logs in real-time. Wait a few minutes to see if it progresses beyond "Running Moodle install script" or throws an error.
If it completes, you might see something like "Moodle installation completed" or Apache startup messages.
3. Verify Installation Progress
If the container is still running but logs are silent:
Access the container:
bash
docker exec -it moodle_app bash
Check if the Moodle config file exists, indicating a successful install:
bash
ls -l /bitnami/moodle/config.php
If it exists, the installation likely completed, and the issue might be with Apache serving the site.
Check Apache logs:
bash
ls -l /opt/bitnami/apache/logs/
cat /opt/bitnami/apache/logs/error_log
4. Test Access
If the container is running:
Visit http://localhost:8080 again.
If you still get a 401:
Try http://localhost:8080/login.
Check if itâ€™s prompting for credentials (use admin/admin123).
If itâ€™s a blank page or another error, the installation might not have finished.
5. Address Potential Stalls
If the container is stuck at "Running Moodle install script" for too long (e.g., >5-10 minutes):
Database Connection:
Verify the database is still accessible:
bash
docker exec -it moodle_db mysql -umoodle -pmoodle -e "SHOW DATABASES;"
Ensure moodle is listed.
From inside moodle_app (if running):
bash
mysql -h db -umoodle -pmoodle -e "SHOW DATABASES;"
If this fails, thereâ€™s a network or credential issue.
Force Restart:
Stop and restart with fresh volumes:
bash
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d
docker logs -f moodle_app
6. Adjust Configuration (if Needed)
If the 401 persists post-install:
Check the generated config.php for anomalies:
bash
cat /bitnami/moodle/config.php
Ensure wwwroot is http://localhost:8080 and credentials match (admin/admin123).
If Apache is misconfigured, add a volume for Apache logs to inspect further:
yaml
volumes:
  - moodle_data:/bitnami/moodle
  - moodledata_data:/bitnami/moodledata
  - ./apache-logs:/opt/bitnami/apache/logs
Then:
bash
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d
ls -l apache-logs/
Expected Outcome
The logs should show the installation completing (e.g., "Moodle setup finished" or Apache starting).
docker ps should list moodle_app as "Up."
http://localhost:8080 should load the Moodle login page, accepting admin/admin123.
If It Still Fails
If the container exits again or you still get a 401:
Share the output of:
docker ps -a
Updated docker logs moodle_app (full output after the restart).
Your current docker-compose.yml (to confirm volume changes).
Let me know if you can access the container and what you find in config.php or Apache logs.
Youâ€™re closeâ€”this looks like a timing or final setup issue with the newer image!

Thanks for the updated output! Weâ€™ve got a clearer picture now: the moodle_app container is exiting with an error (ExitCode: 1) after reaching "Running Moodle install script," and itâ€™s not staying alive long enough for us to debug it interactively. Letâ€™s dig into this and get it fixed.
Key Observations
Container Status:
docker ps -a shows moodle_app (bitnami/moodle:latest) exited 4 minutes ago with Exited (1), meaning it failed during execution.
moodle_db (mysql:5.7) is "Up" and "healthy," so the database container is fine.
Logs:
The logs stop at "Running Moodle install script" (17:37:06.78), with no further output or error messages.
Compared to earlier logs with 4.2.2, the realpath: /bitnami/apache/conf error is gone, suggesting the volume fix or newer image resolved that issue.
However, the lack of additional output after "Running Moodle install script" indicates the script is failing silently or crashing.
Access Attempt:
docker exec -it moodle_app bash failed because the container isnâ€™t running, which aligns with the Exited (1) status.
Timing:
The process from startup (17:37:03.79) to the last log (17:37:06.78) takes about 3 seconds, and then it exits. This is too quick for a full Moodle installation (which typically takes minutes), suggesting an early failure.
Root Cause Hypothesis
The moodle_app container is failing during the "Running Moodle install script" step, likely due to:
Database Connection Issue: It canâ€™t connect to moodle_db, possibly because the database isnâ€™t fully initialized when the script runs, despite the "healthy" status.
Script Error: An unlogged error in the install script (e.g., PHP exception, permission issue, or missing dependency) causes it to exit silently.
Configuration Problem: An environment variable or volume setup might be incompatible with bitnami/moodle:latest.
Steps to Diagnose and Fix
1. Confirm Database Readiness
Even though moodle_db is "healthy," the Moodle install script might be trying to connect before the database is fully ready:
Check the database logs:
bash
docker logs moodle_db
Look for "mysqld: ready for connections" to confirm itâ€™s fully up. Note the timestamp and compare it to 17:37:06.55 (when Moodle tried to connect).
Test connectivity manually:
bash
docker run -it --rm --network 2_docker_moodle_network mysql:5.7 mysql -h moodle_db -umoodle -pmoodle -e "SHOW DATABASES;"
This simulates the connection from the same network. If it fails, thereâ€™s a network or credential issue.
2. Debug the Install Script
Since the container exits, letâ€™s run it manually to catch the error:
Start a temporary container with an interactive shell:
bash
docker run -it --entrypoint bash --network 2_docker_moodle_network bitnami/moodle:latest
Inside, set the environment variables (from your docker-compose.yml):
bash
export MOODLE_DATABASE_TYPE=mysqli
export MOODLE_DATABASE_HOST=moodle_db
export MOODLE_DATABASE_PORT_NUMBER=3306
export MOODLE_DATABASE_NAME=moodle
export MOODLE_DATABASE_USER=moodle
export MOODLE_DATABASE_PASSWORD=moodle
export MOODLE_USERNAME=admin
export MOODLE_PASSWORD=admin123
export MOODLE_EMAIL=admin@example.com
export MOODLE_SITE_NAME="Moodle LMS"
export ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes
export MOODLE_SKIP_BOOTSTRAP=no
export MOODLE_HOST=localhost
export MOODLE_INSTALL_TIMEOUT=1800
export MOODLE_DEBUG=yes
export PHP_MAX_EXECUTION_TIME=600
export PHP_MEMORY_LIMIT=512M
export PHP_POST_MAX_SIZE=100M
export PHP_UPLOAD_MAX_FILESIZE=100M
Run the entrypoint and script:
bash
/opt/bitnami/scripts/moodle/entrypoint.sh /opt/bitnami/scripts/moodle/run.sh
Watch for errors. If it complains about the database, confirm connectivity with:
bash
mysql -h moodle_db -umoodle -pmoodle -e "SHOW DATABASES;"
3. Add Dependency Wait
If the database is the issue, ensure moodle_app waits for moodle_db to be fully ready:
Update docker-compose.yml to add a depends_on with a healthcheck condition:
yaml
version: '3'
services:
  moodle:
    image: bitnami/moodle:latest
    container_name: moodle_app
    restart: no
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    environment:
      # ... your existing env vars ...
    volumes:
      - moodle_data:/bitnami/moodle
      - moodledata_data:/bitnami/moodledata
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy
  db:
    image: mysql:5.7
    container_name: moodle_db
    environment:
      MYSQL_DATABASE: moodle
      MYSQL_USER: moodle
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: moodle
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/mysql
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "mysqladmin", "ping", "-h", "localhost"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5
volumes:
  moodle_data:
  moodledata_data:
  db_data:
Restart:
bash
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d
docker logs -f moodle_app
4. Check Volumes for Corruption
If the script fails due to volume issues:
Inspect the mounted directories:
bash
docker run -it --rm -v 2_docker_moodle_data:/bitnami/moodle -v 2_docker_moodledata_data:/bitnami/moodledata bitnami/moodle:latest bash
Inside:
bash
ls -l /bitnami/moodle /bitnami/moodledata
If theyâ€™re not empty, clear them:
bash
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d
5. Fallback to a Known Version
If latest is buggy, try a specific recent version (e.g., 4.3):
yaml
image: bitnami/moodle:4.3
Then:
bash
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d
docker logs -f moodle_app
Expected Outcome
The logs should progress beyond "Running Moodle install script" and complete the installation.
docker ps should show moodle_app as "Up."
http://localhost:8080 should load the Moodle login page.
If It Still Fails
Please share:
Updated docker logs moodle_app after trying step 3 or 5.
Output from step 2 (manual script run) if you get that far.
Your current docker-compose.yml to confirm changes.
Weâ€™re narrowing it downâ€”likely a timing or script failure issue. Letâ€™s get it running!
