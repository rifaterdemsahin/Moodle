This new error message indicates a different problem - now Apache is running but it's showing a "Forbidden" error, which typically means there's a permissions issue with the files or directories.

Here are the steps to troubleshoot and fix this:

1. The permissions issue is likely with the Moodle files or data directory. Let's add a command to fix permissions in your docker-compose file:

```yaml
services:
  db:
    # Your existing db configuration
    
  moodle:
    image: moodlehq/moodle-php-apache:8.0
    container_name: moodle_app
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    environment:
      # Your existing environment variables
    volumes:
      - moodle_data:/var/www/moodledata
    depends_on:
      - db
    restart: always
    # Add this command to fix permissions when the container starts
    command: >
      bash -c "chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html /var/www/moodledata &&
              chmod -R 755 /var/www/html &&
              chmod -R 777 /var/www/moodledata &&
              apache2-foreground"
```

2. If you're still having issues, try connecting to your container and checking the file structure:

```bash
docker exec -it moodle_app bash
ls -la /var/www/html
ls -la /var/www/moodledata
```

3. You might need to manually set up the Moodle config.php file. Inside the container, check if this file exists:

```bash
cat /var/www/html/config.php
```

If it doesn't exist or is incomplete, this could be causing the issue.

4. Another approach is to remove the volumes and let Moodle recreate them:

```bash
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start fresh and might help if there were any corrupted files or permission issues with the volumes.

Let me know if you want to try any of these approaches or if you need further assistance with a specific part of the troubleshooting.
